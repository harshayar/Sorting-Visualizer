# Sorting-Visualizer
A web-based Sorting Visualizer that animates sorting algorithms like Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort. Users can compare two algorithms side-by-side, adjust array size and speed, and control the process with start, stop, and reset options. Built with JavaScript, it provides an interactive way to learn sorting through real-time visualizations.
