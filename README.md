# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool designed to demonstrate and compare sorting algorithms through real-time animations. It provides an engaging way to understand how different sorting techniques work by visualizing their operations step-by-step.

## Features
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare two sorting algorithms side-by-side.
- **Supported Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Customizable Array**: Adjust the size of the array to sort.
- **Speed Control**: Modify the sorting speed for better visualization.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, stop, or reset the sorting process.

## How It Works
1. Select two sorting algorithms from the dropdown menus.
2. Adjust the array size using the slider.
3. Click "Generate" to create a new array.
4. Click "Start" to begin the visualization.
5. Observe the sorting process with highlighted comparisons and swaps.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing sorting algorithms and interactivity.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Open the project folder:
   <!-- cd sorting-visualizer -->

Open index.html in your browser to start the application.
Future Enhancements
Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
Include performance metrics for each algorithm.
Enhance UI/UX with additional customization options.
